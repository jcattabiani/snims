# SNIMS

### Create a snail society.

Make your own snails with unique backstories and personalities. Watch them interact with each other, become friends (or enemies), and find their place amongst their peers. 

### Built with Chat GPT.

SNIMS uses the Chat GPT API to generate conversations between snails, taking into account their backstories, personalities, and previous interactions. Each snail remembers what it thinks of the other snails, leading to storied relationships and integrated societies. 

### Do it yourself.

To run SNIMS, just clone the repo, insert your Chat GPT API key into `apiService.js`, NPM install, then NPM start!
